## Description:
    Here we created a webpage where Seattelites are able to connect with local charities and orgainzations based on their interests. They can select a variety of interests for example; animals, social issue, politcal organizations, etc. The user is able to choose whether to volunteer their time, donate money, donate used goods/food, etc. We have also included the use of Google Maps to enable the user to search which organizations are in close proximity to their location. 

## Technologies Used:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Bulma
    - Bootstrap
    - Google Maps API
    - Charity API
    - Charity Navigator API

## Things we learned:
    ### When creating this website we ran into a few issues:
    
    - Github: We created a main branch to work on in GitHub but we were unsure of how to gain full access rights. The teamate who created this had to then leave for a few days on paternity which left us with out access to the github repo we created. The instructor told us then to fork the path which worked but left us with push/pull issues with all the teammates. 

    - Google Maps API: This API was diffuclt to gain access to. It wanted us to pay for the service and we had to find a way to work around this.
    
    - We had originally used Bootstrap in creating our website. When we were almost finished, we remembered that the assignment specified that we were to use a CSS framework that we were not taught in class (so not Bootstrap).
