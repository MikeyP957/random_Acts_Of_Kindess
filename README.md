Description:
    Here we created a webpage where Seattlites are able to connect with local charties and orgainzation based on their interest. They can select a variety of interests including animals, social,politcal, etc. The user is able to volunteer their time or make donations via goods, food, or cash. We have also included a map to enable the user to search which organizations are in close proximity to their location. 

Built with:
    - Boostrap
    - Google API
    - Charity API
    - Charity Navigator API

Learning:
    When creating this website we ran into a few key issues
    
- Github: We created a main branch to work on in GitHub but we were unsure of how to gain full access rights. The teamate who created this had to then leave for a few days on paternity which left us with out access to the github repo we created. The instructor told us then to fork the path which worked but left us with push/pull issues with all the teammates. 

- Google Maps API: This API was diffuclt to gain access to. It wanted us to pay for the service and we had to find a way to work around this.
